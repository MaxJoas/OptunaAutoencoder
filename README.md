# OptunaAutoencoder
This repo contains the code for my Medium blogpost. If don't want to copy the code from Medium, you can use the notebook in this repo to
play with my example and make modifications, etc.

## Getting started:
- Create a virtual environment and install the requirements:
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Work with the notebook
